## Welcome to Diverse Stardew Valley!

Diverse Stardew Valley edits the villagers of Pelican Town to add ethnic, cultural, gender identity and body type diversity and unique seasonal and festival outfits for both the vanilla and the alternate diverse character designs. This pack contains character variants and outfits for **Abigail, Caroline, and Pierre.**

The Diverse Stardew Valley project was started by notsnufffie, and is now being continued by the community. The art and coding of this mod was made by the DSV Team with the help of many generous contributors. **[Here is a complete spreadsheet of DSV’s credits!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10e0GPMcKTrzAm93Uhn17ElejMpiuwxh2t-utQvrR66M/edit#gid=5373728﻿)**

A complete visual readme and configuration guide can be found on our [https://github.com/minervamaga/Diverse-Stardew-Valley/wiki](Github wiki)!

**Features:**
* Modded and vanilla character variants
* In-character and weather-appropriate outfits for every season, indoors and out
* Special outfits for festivals and weddings
* Special location-specific outfit for Caroline at the weekly aerobics club
* Maternity outfits for the bachelorettes when pregnant
* Fiances/spouses wear mermaid pendants
* Marriage candidates wear pyjamas in the morning & evening at home and at the farmhouse

### Installation:
This mod requires [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)﻿! Simply unpack and place the “[CP] Diverse Stardew Valley - Abigail, Caroline & Pierre” folder into your Mods folder. 

You can choose which version of each character you would like to use in the config, as well as disable any characters that you may want to use another mod for.

For more detailed installation instructions, check out the readme on our wiki.

If you are updating DSV, delete any previous files from your Mods folder before moving the new files.

NOTE: We do not recommend using Vortex to install Diverse Stardew Valley or other SDV mods. Vortex sometimes fails to correctly remove files when updating or removing mods, which can cause problems. Thanks to SMAPI and Content Patcher, SDV mods are simple to install or uninstall manually.

### Config Options:
To simplify the process of configuring this mod, we recommend that you use the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098), which will also allow you to configure all your other content packs in-game. Alternatively, you can open the `premade_modded_config.json` file from the mod folder with a text editor on your computer. If this is your first time using the mod, rename the file to config.json for its settings to be recognized by the mod. A full list of the options and the choices for each one is detailed in the wiki readme.

 Some options in the config.json only apply to certain variants of characters or depend on the values of other options. Do not delete options from the config file even if they seem irrelevant to your game! If for some reason you delete, rename or corrupt the config.json file, it will be recreated automatically the next time the game launches, with default options selected.

If you would rather not select individual character options or would like to jump straight in with modded characters variants, DSV includes a “premade_modded_config.json" sample file with a random selection of non-vanilla character options - simply rename it to config.json and play.

**Full vs. Lightweight vs. Ultralight**
Each character will have an option labelled `[CharacterName]LightweightConfig`, which configures how much content and thus impact on the performance of your game that character will have. All options will include seasonal and festival outfits, but differences between the three options are:

* Full: The character will have all available content enabled, including multiple outfits per season (if possible), indoor and outdoor outfit variations, pyjamas, mermaid pendants, and location- or time-based outfit variations (where applicable).
* Light: The character will have one outfit per season with indoor and outdoor variations, time-based content will be disabled, and other additional features will be minimised.
* Ultralight: The character will have one outfit per season with no indoor and outdoor variations and additional features will be reduced to only those specific to DSV alternate character designs.

**Translations**
DSV has i18n translation support for both its configuration option names and descriptions and its dialogue edits. If you are a translator who is interested in helping to translate DSV, please feel free to reach out!


### Compatibility:
**To use different portrait/character sprite mods with DSV, just set the affected characters’ variants to “off” in this mod.** Many alternate character designs from other modders (including all of the variants from previous versions of the mod) can be found in the optional standalone Add-On character packs, which are currently available to download from [our wiki](https://github.com/minervamaga/Diverse-Stardew-Valley/wiki/Downloads) and will be uploaded to ModDrop when they are ready.

__**INCOMPATIBLE MODS**__

**Seasonal Villager Outfits / Seasonal Outfits - Slightly Cuter Aesthetic**
DSV is not compatible with Seasonal Villager Outfits or Seasonal Outfits - Slightly Cuter Aesthetic, as both mods have the same function. However, Diverse Stardew Valley also includes seasonal outfits for all of the vanilla characters, so DSV can be used as a replacement for SVO or SCA.

**Portrait or sprite mods that affect all characters**
DSV is not compatible with portrait or sprite mods that affect all characters as the mods will override each other.

__**COMPATIBLE MODS**__

**Surfing Festival**
DSV is compatible by default with Surfing Festival and characters will wear swimwear at the festival.

**[Ridgeside Village](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7286)**
DSV is compatible by default with Ridgeside Village and characters will wear appropriate clothing at Ridgeside Village's festivals and wedding reception. This pack also contains compatibility files for Ridgeside Village's Bert and Trinnie, so that one or both will be of Filipino descent to match with DSV's Filipino Caroline option.

**[Platonic Partners and Friendships](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8146)**
Compatibility with PPAF is built in to DSV, but must be enabled both in PPAF's config file and in DSV's config file. Add a marriage candidate's name to the config option and they will wear a unique outfit at PPAF's commitment ceremony and will not blush in their love portrait.

**[East Scarp](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/984954-east-scarp)**
DSV is compatible by default with an upcoming East Scarp Spirits' Eve get-together and characters will wear Spirits' Eve costumes at the event.

DSV is compatible by default with Ridgeside Rival Hearts - Sam and Alissa, and characters will wear appropriate clothing at Sam and Alissa's wedding.

### Android Users:
DSV is currently incompatible with Android due to requiring Content Patcher 1.24 for its configuration translations. Android-compatible files are in progress and will be made available as soon as they have been tested and confirmed to be working.
